    <h3 id="five">What Is css?</h3>
    <p class="femcoder">
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
      and JavaScript.CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page
      layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as
      the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices
    </p>

    <h3 id="one">What do I have to install to use CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      I installed Visual code studio in order to be able to write my structural
      code for my trial websites. I am able to style my strutural code with CSS.
    </p>


    <h3 id="four">The anatomy of CSS is as follows:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>selector</span>
        This is the CSS element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the
        elements to be styled. p is the selector. But can be changed depending
        on hwat you want to style.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Declaration</span>
        This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the
        element's properties you want to style.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>property value</span>This specifies what you can change like from
        red to black.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A quick Summary</h3>
    <p>Remember the simple points below of how css works:</p> 
        <ul>
    <li>
        The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</li>
        <li>
        The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</li>
    <li>
        Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
