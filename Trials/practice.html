    What is it that fuels you? For me, it’s the strength that I derive when I
    look back at how much I have grown, how much I have overcome in the so many
    wins in the smallest ways as a young woman. I have always been creative but
    I also wanted to engage others. I believed establishing a site that was
    accessible to many and that allowed them to express themselves as young and
    zealous girls developing into adults they want to be was a great way to
    share stories, experiences, and inspiration with others. The Diaries Of The
    Young Adult is truly my own little passion project, gaining more and more
    traction each day. I hope you enjoy browsing my site and all of the unique
    content I have to offer. Take a look around; perhaps you’ll discover what
    fuels you as well. Read on and enjoy the many stories and creative
    expressions from girls all around the world!

  My name is Faith Sampaya, I am currently doing a course in nursing. Growing up
  I didn’t have it easy and I am honestly grateful to God for looking at where I
  am today.  I did fail my first year of nursing school and I felt crushed that
  the person I really wanted to be wasn’t possible. I felt ashamed and scared to
  face the family members who have been taking care of my school fees. Nights
  and days went by and I felt the weight of repeating my first year. It took a
  lot to not give up,It took a lot to work on the bunch of workloads and it took
  a lot of newfound determination and discipline to fight for the person I want
  to be.I hope you too find that and keep fighting for the future you!
